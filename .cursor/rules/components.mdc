# Component Usage

Components are located in `src/lib/components/`. Key points:

- Components use Svelte 5 syntax
- Components are exported through [src/lib/components/index.js](mdc:src/lib/components/index.js)
- Custom components for documentation are available globally in MDSvex files through the layout system

## PackageManagerSelector

The [PackageManagerSelector](mdc:src/lib/components/PackageManagerSelector.svelte) component:
- Provides tabbed interface for different package managers
- Used in documentation to show installation commands
- Props: `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun` for respective commands
- Example usage in markdown:
```svelte
<PackageManagerSelector 
  npm="npm install pkg"
  pnpm="pnpm add pkg"
  yarn="yarn add pkg"
  bun="bun add pkg"
/>
```
